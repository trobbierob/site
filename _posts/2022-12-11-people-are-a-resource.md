My posts finally appear the way that I wanted them to.

I knew the issue somehow was related to the JavaScript and CSS files not being able to found. One of my initial concerns with learning testing was that I didn't have the necessary foundation of how HTML/CSS/JS interact with one another. I'm great at being a student, but I wanted a community to learn from, so I turned to [#100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/){:target="_blank"} to help me carry the logs.

A part of carrying the boats and the logs turns out to be open to learning in public and reaching out for help. This blog is my way of showcasing that journey. The second part that I need to remind myself of is that I'm closer to the answer than I think.

## People are a resource

I've got Discords, Slacks, and Twitter group chats full of people who want to help each other succeed. I reached out in Discord and literally minutes later, someone led me in the right direction to solve this. Something I'd been toying with over a course of a few days got resolved in minutes just by reaching out to a stranger. Every problem you have, someone else has had it and solved it so that you don't have to work as hard. Remember your resources. Remember your people.
