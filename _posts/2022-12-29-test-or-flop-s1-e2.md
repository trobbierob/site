Recently there have been a few projects geared towards testing gambling sites. I'm not a gambler, so I feel like I'd fit right in. I signed up, made my appointment to go over it with the Test Engineer (TE) but my account was immediately suspended. The TE mentioned that happened to a few other people, however because I showed up ready and on time, they would send me a reward for participating (I thought that was great for less than 10 minutes of work).

The odd thing was that when I reached out to support about my account, they informed me that it was all automated and that they couldn't modify or manually verify any accounts themselves. I don't know how true that is, I feel like most automatation tools come with the ability to dig your hands in and maually tweek them, but that's not up to me. 

The TE, however, put me down to invite me to future projects, so that's a win. Half of the battle is simply showing up.

$82.50 down, $917.50 to go. Time to file another bug report.
