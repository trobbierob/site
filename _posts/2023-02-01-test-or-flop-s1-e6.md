subtitle: season 1 finale

We're at the end of the first season of Test or Flop, and if we only look at the results of the payouts, we might consider it a flop. However, despite not reaching our monetary goal we:

* Filed 6 bug reports
* Completed 7 test cases
* Received 1 bonus payment
* Increased our rank to Bronze 
* Reached our highest monthly payout at $241.50

I believe since we're out of the holiday season there will be more opportunities for and more time to spend on testing. On the next season I'll keep the same goal, but commit to a more consistent update schedule and perhaps a new markdown page template for individual bug reports. I haven't decided if the template will be used for all bugs or just the ones that I find to be interesting to write about.

Until then, time to file another bug report!
