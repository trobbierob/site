I haven't done any testing in a while. So much so that I've dropped down from Silver to Proven. I'm still interested in testing, but I needed to take a break. 

In my quest to learn all of the things, I've started taking a Red Hat course at the local community college. Initially I was excited, but somewhere between the first and third week of us focusing on how to setup the VMs, my red flag alarms started going off. I mean, this class was $650. I need us to move it along, especially considering it's only two days a week.

Early on I had this idea to create a study group. The course manager created one through Whatsapp, but it's not really active. It's just used for updates on the Zoom links. A few weeks ago we were on spring break and ran a poll on whether to have class or not. Most people (I felt), were good with continuing to have class, but it was cancelled. And, when I ask if anyone wanted to meet up prior to the class or during the original class time... crickets. As far materials, I've sent the objectives of the test to the chat, and a video on what to expect when taking the test. So, I've got a class that's promising us hope with being able to pass a certifcation, and classmates who aren't interested in meeting up to get ahead. Class was actually cancelled today. Instead of having free time, I started using my cert guide and going through the chapters and practicing the labs. I've been adding notes to my Obsidian notebook, so that's been working out. I have to stop myself from wanting to jot down everything, so I'm really focusing on frequently used commands and relevant examples.

Now, you might say, if the class isn't going anywhere - why stay? Well, I'm still figuring that part out. I do want to understand Linux, so it's an easy way to have dedicated practice time, so that's cool. But, I think I will say something about the pace because we only have a few weeks left, and we have a lot of objectives to meet.
