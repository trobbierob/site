subtitle: If it's free, it's for me

I was on Twitter recently and signed up for a swag giveaway, but they were giving away more than they bargained for.

To join the giveaway, all one needed to do was to be a part of the first 'x' amount people to like the post and follow the account. Shortly after you'll be DM'd with the shop url and the coupon code for your free item.

It was a very simple shop with just a few items. I didn't see the size shirt I wanted, and I don't typically wear hats, but I figured, "It's free", so whatever I'll get a hat. The shirts, the hats and the other items were all different prices so I was curious as to what the code was good for. Would it simply knock off one item from the total? Was there a dollar amount associated with it? Since I'm doing all of this testing, I figured I'd see what was what.

As it turns out the code actually discounted everything in the cart. I could've received $500 worth (or more) of clothing for the low low price of $0. Why can't I find coupons like this for Amazon or Sallie Mae? Could you imagine having a coupon code for student loans? What a dream.

Now, once I discovered it, I told them right away and they fixed it right away as well. Talk about a close call. I'll consider this making my goal of finding my first big flaw. Now, I did put a hat and a shirt in my cart as a reward, so we'll see what happens when it arrives.
