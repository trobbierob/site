In [Episode 3](https://trobbierob.github.io/2022/12/29/test-or-flop-s1-e3.html) I was testing a shopping website and making my way down a long spreadsheet of to-dos. Well, this is the payment for the spreadsheet. The three $3 bugs I found were the result of me exploring somewhat beyond the list. The spreadsheet serves as a path to take, but typically if you want to find bugs, you'll need to make a pitstop at several locations to find something good. Settings tend to be where I find the majority of my bugs. If you come across a page has the ability to filter, change a language, or adjust settings, there's bound to be a bug waiting for you. 

In other news, my rating went up to Bronze!

Now that I'm not just *Rated*, I get a 2.5% premium on all approved reports. I'm going to need it since I'm far from my current goal. 

$238.50 down, $761.50 to go. Time to file another bug report!
