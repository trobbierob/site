subtitle: Let's learn to automate!
---

A few weeks ago, I was inspired by Alan Richardson's [Automating in the Browser](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/automating-in-the-browser-using-javascript/) course. Not only did it show me the power of the browser and JavaScript, but he also broke down the process of identifying html elements, creating reusable methods and then extending it to work automatically. Because of that, I thought to try it out on the testing website I started with for UTest.

## [Academy Bugs](https://academybugs.com/find-bugs/)


The website's focus is to explain different types of bugs. Once you find a bug, the screen pauses and gives you a brief discription of what took place.

My thought was to start small and simply automate what a shopper would do (clicking images, adding products to the cart, clicking links, etc.), so I started writing methods.


### Add a random item to cart

    function getRandomItem() {
        // Although there are 18 articles of clothing, only 14 have add to cart buttons
        let num = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 24, 25, 26, 27]
        return num[Math.floor(Math.random() * num.length)];
    }

    function addToCart(){
        // Add random product to cart
        document.querySelector(`#ec_add_to_cart_${getRandomItem()}`).click()
    }

    for(i=0; i<100; i++){
        addToCart();
    }

### View the Cart
    
    document.querySelector("#ec_product_page > div.ec_product_added_to_cart > a").click()


### Close the bug hint

    document.querySelector("#popmake-4406 > button").click()


### Select a random product

    function getRandomInt() {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * 54);
    }

    function selectProduct(){
        document.querySelectorAll(".ec_image_link_cover")[getRandomInt()].click()
    }

    selectProduct();

Currently this will find _1_ of the _25_ bugs (feel free to find out which one). I want to hit 25, but I don't think I can automate all 25 based on how some of the bugs are activated. That doesn't really bother me since this is all for fun anyway. I shall return with more methods and hopefully a proper test scenario.
