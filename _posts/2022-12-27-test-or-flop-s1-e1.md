| Description  | Reward  |
|---|---|
| Completed training test case for a credit card  | $7  |
| Created a bug report for missing icons on a webpage | $1.50  |
| Completed test case for a biometric app  | $40  |
| Completed a test case for a DNS check | $4 |
| Total | $52.50 |

I had another opportunity to do the biometric app again, but I had too much going on at the time. It would've been another easy $40 but I'm sure a similiar project will come around. I've signed up for a few projects since then but have yet to discover any meaningful bugs.

$52.50 down, $947.50 to go. Time to file another bug report.
