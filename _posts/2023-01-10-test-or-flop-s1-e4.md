Sometimes a bug isn't considered a bug. Before embarking on this testing journey I read a few blog posts and watched a few Youtube videos of testers discussing the importance of not getting too attached to bugs. Or, at the very least, don't take it personally if they aren't viewed as valuable.

I was testing a hotel application. Actually it was more like a full travel application. Anyways, I noticed that if you were to view several hotels, check your view history, clear it, and browse several more hotels, your new history wouldn't load. Not only would it not load, but you also were unable to navigate away from that page and needed to exit out of the app. Once you opened the app again, you would be able to view your previously searched hotels.

I felt this was a legitmate bug. Nothing crazy (and still not the big bug I'm searching for). However, this testing cycle was only looking for blocker issues only. This is why it's important to view and understand the focus areas of the test cases. Since technically you can go about your business booking your hotel without needing to see your history, my bug report was rejected and deemed *Works As Designed*. If that bug counted, I could've made between $5-$19.

$223.50 down, $776.50 to go. Time to file another bug report!
